# hello-world

Hello there! My name is Yuri Ferreira, and you can call me 'Yuri' or 'Y'. I speak Portuguese (Brazil) as well as English (still needs improving)
and interested in Japanese (I hope I can learn some day).

This is the beginning of my studies.
I'm starting my studies on programming/computing, as well as I'll be saving logs from future projects.

No plans for the future at this moment, but any changes of it, I'll update this markdown file.
